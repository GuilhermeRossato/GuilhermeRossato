### Welcome to my Github profile 

I am a Brazilian developer and data-engineer who loves to experiment with technology and create interesting projects to solve all sort of problems. Although I like backend development I have projects in all sort of stacks, I'm a Computer Engineer bachelor and understand everything from low-level network protocols to high-level software concepts, methodologies and tools. Feel free to look around, most repositories here are personal projects entirely built by me, the professional ones are private, of course.

I love programming all sort of things, from hardware level stuff like C on microcontrollers to modern scripts like python / typescript / node.js, etc.

I also have some snippets that might be useful for other devs: https://gist.github.com/GuilhermeRossato
