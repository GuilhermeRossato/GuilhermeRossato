### Welcome to my Github profile 

I am a Brazilian developer who loves to try new things. Most of my projects are in english so feel free to look around.

By the way every repository was made by me fully unless the project is a fork of another repo!

I love programming all sort of things, from hardware level stuff like C on microcontrollers to modern javascript, typescript and node.js scripts.

I also have some small snippets of code that I found to be valuable: https://gist.github.com/GuilhermeRossato.

I'm currently open for remote work so if you want to contact me regarding opportunities you can do so privately via [email](mailto:guilhermrossato@gmail.com) or through [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilherme-rossato/)). No need to be formal, I value effective communication over formalities.
