### Welcome to my Github profile 

I am a Brazilian developer and data-engineer who loves to experiment with technology and create interesting projects to solve all sort of problems. Although I like backend development I have projects in all sort of stacks, I've graduated in Computer Engineering and love programming all sort of things, from hardware level stuff like C on microcontrollers to modern scripts like python / typescript / node.js, etc. Feel free to look around, most repositories here are personal projects entirely built by me, the professional ones are private, of course.

I also have some snippets that might be useful if you're a developer: https://gist.github.com/GuilhermeRossato
